Most of the training sessions listed here so far are based on the work of 
[Pavel Tsatsouline](https://www.strongfirst.com/about/pavel-tsatsouline/) and 
[Dan John](https://danjohnuniversity.com/) in the book they wrote together 
[Easy Strength.](https://www.dragondoor.com/easy-strength-ebook/?srsltid=AfmBOorbU7hZq2NAQ0t1NLdv4ndij_SGJnGAiJhcl1L-EVwDHcRTH2hZ)

But more specifically Dan John's later work 
[Easy Strength for Fatloss](https://danjohnuniversity.com/bookstore), the Easy 
Strength Omnibook and The Armor Building Formula. Once I finish a round or two
of ES4FL I'll switch over to Armor Building for a round or two. Maybe after that
I'll switch to Pavel's 
[Simple and Sinister](https://www.strongfirst.com/shop/books/simple-sinister-book/)
for a while.
